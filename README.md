# HollywoodCenter
A breadth-first search implementation that solves the popular Bacon Number problem.  

## Build
All source code can be found in the `src` directory.  
Two data files can be found in the `data` directory.  

To choose which file to process, change line 152 in `HollywoodGraph.java` to read in whichever data file you want to process.  
Data must be in the form `Movie/Actor` with no spaces in between the slashes or at the end of each line. See the following example:  
```
Movie 1/Actor 1/Actor 2/Actor 3
Movie 2/Actor 4/Actor 5
```
